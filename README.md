# Overview

A data scientist is a professional who uses advanced analytical and statistical methods to extract insights from data. In addition, they have expertise in data manipulation, statistical modeling, and machine learning. A data scientist uses these skills to analyze complex and large datasets to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can inform business decisions, improve products and services, and drive innovation. Data scientists work in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and technology, among others. Data scientists' salaries have increased in line with the demand, and they can anticipate earning a six-figure income.

Data science positions are among the most sought-after and rapidly expanding roles in the technology industry. Data Scientist jobs have surged by 650% since 2012, and this trend is expected to continue. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for data science skills will rise by another 27.9% by 2026.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis approach that aims to summarize and visually represent the main features of a dataset. EDA helps us understand the data's structure and distribution before using statistical models or machine learning algorithms.
